# DeepQuery Code

<br/>
<br/>

> DeepQuery Code is your solution for turning your code projects into dynamic, actionable insights. With DeepQuery Code, you can effortlessly connect your code packs and interact with your customized AI chatbot, enabling you to extract valuable information, explore complex data sets, and gain deeper understanding from your resources.

<br/>

> DeepQuery Code is different than DeepQuery. The main difference is DeepQuery Code is for github projects and code related files while DeepQuery is for everything else.

<br/>

### How it works

> DeepQuery Code connects directly to your structured code packs, allowing you to ask complex questions and get relevant responses based on the content within these packs. By utilizing a vector search algorithm, DeepQuery Code identifies and retrieves the most relevent code points, helping you find exactly what you’re looking for with minimal effort.

<br/>

### Switch back and fourth between packs quick and easy

> DeepQuery Code makes it very easy to change packs and subjects. just click on ***"Use pack data"*** and select a different pack than the ones you are using.
> ***Packs are optional***, you do not need to use any data at all to use DeepQuery Code! Just select ***"No Pack"*** to use Deepquery with no added data!

<br/>

### Query your data with or without AI intervention.

> ***Query your data with a chatbot***. Once you select your pack of choice, you can now query your data with a chatbot. The chatbot will use your data as the context for all of your quiries. 

<br/>

> ***Raw query your data directly without a chatbot***. Once you select your pack of choice, you can query just your code pack data without a chat model! Once you enter your query you will recieve the vector search algorithm results of your query displaying the relevent bits of your data.

<br/>

> ***Note:*** If you select ***"No Pack"*** you cannot preform a raw query. Raw queries can only be performed with pack data.

<br/>

### Choose a selection of AI generated prompts or use your own custom ones.

<br/>

### Generated

> Dont know what prompt to use? No worries just use one of ours! DeepQuery Code offers a variety of pre-generated AI prompts to help you explore your code effortlessly. These prompts are designed to cover a broad range of scenarios and typical queries, making it easy for you to engage with your data even if you’re new to the platform or unfamiliar with the content.

<br/>

>  Simply browse through the available options and select a prompt that fits your needs. Whether you’re looking to get a quick summary, identify key insights, or dive into specific sections of your dataset, these AI-generated prompts provide a solid starting point to get the most out of your data without needing to craft a detailed question yourself.

<br/>

### Custom

> To create more tailored and specific interactions, you can use the Custom Prompt feature to craft your own queries. This allows you to go beyond the standard AI-generated prompts and ask questions that are directly relevant to your unique data and research needs.

<br/>

>  To get started, simply select the ***“Custom Prompt”*** option, type your desired question, command, or prompt into the input field, and submit it to the chatbot. The AI will then analyze your input using the context provided by your selected data pack, delivering responses that are finely tuned to your request. This flexibility enables you to explore complex topics, retrieve detailed insights, or address highly specific use cases that may not be covered by the default prompts.

<br/>

> Custom prompts are ideal when you want precise answers, perform in-depth analysis, or interact with your data in a way that aligns with your specific project requirements.

## Getting into it with DeepQuery Code

<br/>

### brief explanation

<br/>

> ### First go to (DeepQuery Code link)

<br/>

### Using DeepQuery Code without pack data

> Click on ***"select pack"*** then choose the option ***"No Pack"***.

<br/>

> Toggle the chatbot on with the toggle button

<br/>
